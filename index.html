          <p> In Montgomery County Public Schools, data shows that poverty and affluence are bigger determinants of student success than the location of their school.</p>
          <p> The school system found eight of its schools in the <a href="https://www.montgomeryschoolsmd.org/PRESS/index.aspx?pagetype=showrelease&id=10690&type=current&startYear=&pageNumber=3&mode=" target="_blank">500 high schools in the country </a>as ranked by U.S. News and World Report, and 15 of those in the top 25 schools in Maryland. </p>
          <p> On paper, the data looks positive for students. </p>

          <p> Gaithersburg High School is also a majority-minority school, but at a much bigger scale. The U.S. News and World Report found 86.7% of students were members of a minority group, with Hispanic students taking the top spot at 53.2% and Black students at 23%.

          <p>The differences don’t stop there.</p>
          <p> In the same report, the U.S. News and World Report found only 5% Wootton High School of students were considered “Economically Disadvantaged,” compared to 43% of students at Gaithersburg High School.</p>
          <p>This deviation of data may be the crux of the matter, at least according to former Montgomery County Public Schools Superintendent Jack Smith.</p>
          <p> In a 2019 Washington Post editorial, Smith acknowledged the high levels of success for many — but not all — students in the county.</p>

          <p>Smith cited research which showed that the achievement gap “disproportionately affects students of color and students affected by poverty,” and remarked that data aggregation methods, such as the Maryland Public Schools Report Card, does not allow school districts to neither “understand which subgroups may need additional focus to close the gaps nor act in a timely manner for those students who need immediate intervention and support.”</p>
          <p>Smith said Montgomery County Public Schools’s new reporting tool, called the Equity Accountability Model, would aid schools in understanding the impact they have “on the opportunity to learn and the opportunity to excel for student groups that have historically underperformed” in county schools.</p>
          <p>Echoing the data found earlier in this story, Smith noted that the majority of white and Asian students not in poverty, like the 5% at Wootton High School, have higher rates of success in Montgomery County Public Schools.</p>

          <p> Smith said the Equity Accountability Model also confirmed the assumption that <strong>“an achievement gap exists for some students of color, some students in poverty and, most significantly, some students of color in poverty."</strong></p>

          <p> Most notably, Smith highlighted the fact that the Equity Accountability Model countered the myth that students within a focus population race group, such as Black or Hispanic students, have the same lower performance. Instead, Smith stressed the data found that “for race group members not affected by poverty, performance is higher.”</p>
          <p>And, as the data used in this story confirms, the Equity Accountability Model shows that schools in different communities, across different socioeconomic levels, “have demonstrated success serving all students.”</p>
          <p>As the Equity Accountability Model continues to iterate and expand, Smith sees data as a way to bring to light a “crisis…that has been in the shadows for a half-century.”</p>
          <p>“We must use data as a flashlight to act with urgency, purpose and passion to combat this crisis and give all students the access and opportunity they need to succeed.”</p>
